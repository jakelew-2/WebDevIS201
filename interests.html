        <p class="interestp">Golf is the ultimate mental challenge in my opinion. There is no defense, the ball is stationary, and the goal seems simple. But in golf things never go as planned and every detail of a swing matters. Golf has been a great challenge for me and allowed me to learn discipline and mental strength. Last summer I worked my way from a 15 handicap (which means I scored 15 strokes over par on average) down to a 5 handicap. I achieved my goal of shooting even par through 18 holes, which is a rare thing for the average golfer to do.
            One of my favorite golfers is Tiger Woods, he is definitely the GOAT, but have you ever wondered how much he has walked during his career? Here is a tableau graph showing that very thing.

        <p>I have been playing soccer since I was about three years old and I have always loved this sport more than the others that I played. Growing up I was always the fastest player on my team and I loved it. I played all throughout highschool and a little bit in college. During my career I won one state championship and got second two other times. Here are some cool Cristiano Ronaldo goals for your viewing pleasure.</p>
        <h4 class="subheadings" id="Tennis">Tennis</h4>
        <p>I didn't play tennis as much as the other sports I played, but now it is one of my favorites. I picked it up fairly recently but I played as a kid so it was easy to regain the fundamentals of the sport. I have three other friends who love tennis so we often go play doubles together. At first they were all much better than I was but now we are all close to the same level which makes our matches exciting and competitive.</p>

        <h4 class="subheadings" id="Clash">Clash Royale<img src="assets/img/Clash Royale Deck.jpeg" class="clashdeck" alt="Clash Royale Deck"></h4>
        <p>Clash Royale has been a staple in my video gaming life since the day it was released. I use a 3.8 elixir deck and have accumulated  7000+ trophies throughout my life. I am in the Dragon's Spa arena which is third from the top. My favorite card to use is Ram Rider because she plays great offense but can also play really good defense if used correctly.</p>

        <h4 class="subheadings" id="COD">Call of Duty</h4>
        <p>Call of Duty was one of the first games I played on the XBox. I have made a lot of random friends while playing this game and it was the only thing that got me through the pandemic. My fondest memory was when I went 28 and 2 in a round. It was awesome.</p>
        <h4 class="subheadings" id="GH">Guitar Hero</h4>
        <p>Guitar Hero is a game that I picked up a couple years ago but I love it so much. I have always thought that playing the guitar would be so cool but I tried to learn it and it was way too hard, so I pivoted to Guitar Hero. I love the thrill of being able to complete a really hard song or guitar solo. My favorite song to play is Cult of Personality, I usually play that on on Hard difficulty because Expert difficulty is just insane.</p>
